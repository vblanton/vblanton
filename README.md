👋 Hello, my name is Vlad. <br />
✨ Most recently I finished building an automated liquidity provision cli app using Solana based SDKs (private repo) and currently working on optimizing things and embarking on new projects.<br /> 
✨ I was also working on an inventory management app for aid organizations [AidSupply](https://github.com/aidsupply).<br />
